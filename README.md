# Overview

This is a project designed to create a playlist feature.

## Available Scripts

The client side fetches a json containing songs,
It then populates the page with catogories and maps each song
to its category.

After the page has loaded, the user has an option to create his own
playlists, by picking any song he wishes.

The playlist has the following features:
- Can add and remove songs.
- Can create multiple playlists, delete them and make a list of playlists.

### Stack

I used React.js as the front-end of the project.
for the backend i simply found an online json with songs,
and made the neccessery adjustments in my code to proccess the information,
within that code.
